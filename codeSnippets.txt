Notes for creating, pushing and merging branches
1. Before creating a feature branch, make sure the main branch is committed. 
2. Now create a new branch and switch to that branch to make changes.
3. When feature is added and functional, add and commit in the terminal.
4. Once the changes have been committed, push to github with `git push + authorname + branchname`
    For example `git push gt changeReadme` or `git push origin addCSS` or `git push bl makeDivs`
    To check the author name, type `git remote -v` in the terminal and it will print out a few lines - the author name will be at the beginning of those lines.
5. Go to the GitHub repo and click on the green button that says "Compare & pull request"
6. Add any notes about the pull request that might be important (what did you change, why did you change it, etc.)
7. Click on the "Create pull request" button
    After clicking "Create pull request", the next step might be further down on the page. Scroll if you don't see it.
8. Click the "Merge pull request" button
9. Click "Confirm merge"
10. Once the page updates, click "Delete branch" to delete the branch from the remote repo (optional)
11. Go back to the local terminal (terminal in VS code or command line) and switch into the main branch 
12. Pull the changes down from GitHub using the command `git pull authorname main`
    For example `git pull tg main` or `git pull origin main` or `git pull bl main`
    Before you pull the changes down, you can check the author name by typing `git remote -v`
