| User Story | Image |
|----------- | ----- |
|  As a user I want to agree to continue to the application and see the instructions so that I know how to interact with the application  |  ![Consent to continue modal](img/userStoryContinue.png)  |
|  As a user I want to be able to play any note on the keyboard   |    ![Image Alt](img/userStoryFreePlay1.png)     |
|  As a user, when I play a note on the keyboard, I want to hear the corresponding sound and see animations occur on the screen   |    ![Image Alt](img/userStoryFreePlay2.png)     |
|  As a user I want to be able to switch between `free play` mode and `learn melody` mode  |    ![Image Alt](img/userStoryLearnMel1.png)  |
|  As a user I want to see an indication of which key is first in the melody so that I know how to begin playing the song  |    ![Image Alt](img/userStoryLearnMel2.png)     |
|  As a user, when I play the indicated key, I want to hear the corresponding note and see the word or syllable at that stage in the song represented on the canvas. I want to see an indication of which note is next in the melody, so that I know how to continue playing the song  |    ![Image Alt](img/userStoryLearnMel3.png).      |
|  As a user, I want to receive an indication when I have finished playing the song  |    ![Image Alt](img/userStoryLearnMel4.png)    |

- As a user, I want to be able to return to either `free play` or `learn melody` mode / pages
- As a user, I want to know if I've made a mistake
